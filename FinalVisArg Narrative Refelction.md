###Narrative Refelction
When thinking about the rhetorical gaols of this work, the purpose of this is remind an audience of researchers/scientists about the importance of health communication. The narrative depicted shows a scientist finding the cure for cancer, failing to effectively communicate their findings to professionls, and lastly failing to communicate the cure to the public. This all leads to the cure for cancer being ultimately meaningless. The context in which this work will be shown is a graphic/poster in a research lab.
