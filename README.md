# Visual Argument Introduction

The goal of this project is to persuade an audience of researchers about the importance of health communication. If someone discovered the cure for cancer but failed to communicate it properly to their colleagues and failed to gain the trust of the public, then the cure for cancer is ultimately meaningless. Through this graphic, I hope to remind researchers that it should be a priority to improve their health communication skills, as this area is often overlooked. In this final draft, I showcased each scene of this narrative from left to right using arrows to guide the viewer's eyes. The originally illustrated graphics were purposefully designed to be more "cartoon-like" to emphasize the simplicity of the point while also making it easier for the audience to comprehend. Repetition of drawings such as the scientist and the cure are used to convey the story of how the cure for cancer is ultimately meaningless if effective health communication is not employed.
