# Visual Argument Introduction

The goal of this project is to persuade an audience of researchers about the importance of health communication. If someone discovered the cure for cancer, but failed to communicate it properly to their colleagues and failed to gain the trust of the public, then the cure for cancer is ultimately meaningless. Through this graphic, I hope to remind researchers that it should be a priority to improve their health communication skills, as this area is often overlooked. The initial vision was to create an inverted pyramid with each of the "scenes" I just described, as this will help guide the viewer's eyes and show the impact of the cure for cancer growing smaller and smaller. In this preview, I showcased each scene of this narrative from top to bottom, but I plan on making some design changes later on to improve readability.
